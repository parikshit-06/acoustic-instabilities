# Acoustic Instabilities in Combustion Systems

This repository explores **acoustic instabilities** in rocket engine combustion chambers using simplified models. The assignments simulates pressure oscillations caused by the coupling of combustion dynamics with acoustic resonance - a key challenge in designing stable propulsion systems.

## ðŸ§  Background

Acoustic instabilities arise when unsteady heat release couples with the natural acoustic modes of the chamber. These feedback loops can grow over time and lead to:

* Structural damage
* Performance loss
* Mission failure

This project builds a foundation to understand these dynamics using simplified numerical models.
